# **Quantum Research Trend Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This project processes and analyzes quantum-related research papers from arXiv. The goal is to identify key research trends in quantum machine learning using NLP and topic modeling techniques.  

---

## **Dataset**  
The dataset used is **arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json**, sourced from Kaggle.  

### **Download the Dataset:**  
1. Get the dataset from Kaggle.  
2. Place it in the project folder.  

---

## **Running the Pipeline**  
To process the dataset and perform topic modeling, run the following commands:  

```bash
python data_processing.py
python topic_modeling.py
python visualization.py
```

---

## **Generated Outputs**  
| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `quantum_papers.csv` | Filtered quantum-related papers. |
| `quantum_papers_cleaned.csv` | Cleaned abstracts with preprocessed text. |
